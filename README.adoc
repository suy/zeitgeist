A graphical frontend for WeiDU

== "Unofficial" branch made by suy

This is an "unofficial" branch with a few changes from the original codebase
from Wisp, who is the main author, and the WeiDU maintainer. The build has
(temporarily?) stripped any support for ZIP files, and it has improved a few
internal things, hopefully without regressions.

The main feature is to provide automated builds for Windows, Mac, and Linux,
however.

Feel free to get them from https://github.com/suy/zeitgeist/actions[the Workflow
runs on Github], or ask @suy for a build.
